<h2>About Us</h2>
</div>
<div class="product-dec">
<p> We are based out of Florida , We get some many messages asking where we are located ! Why ? This is because we have a huge problem in this industry , these graphic kits are being mislabeled as WRAPS.</p>
<p>As some of you know , wraps are professionally installed by a wrap shop and take a tremendous work to install as they need to be fitted and trimmed . </p>
<p>What we sell are Graphic Kits , Why are they called this and not a wrap ? </p>
<p>We call them Graphic kits because that is what they are ! Each part is cut to fit your machine ! No trimming is required at all !! </p>
<p>These are ( Adult Puzzles ) just put the parts where they go in the diagram and you're done . Simple and easy to install. </p>
<p>( Note ) We do use the word WRAP on our website but it's used as a keyword only , Since everyone is using the wrong term in the industry we have to follow that word so you can find our website :) </p>
<p>Easy and simple to install , We have seen a lot of 14 or 15 year old do this . </p>
<p>Thanks ! </p>
